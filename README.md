# Webpack Exercises

* Fix the `webpack.config.js` file. (paths should be relative to the `webpack.config.js` file)
* `npm run test:*` to run tests for an exercise, where * is the exercise number (e.g. `npm run test:1`)
* `npm run test` or `npm run grade` to run all tests and see your current grade
